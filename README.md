# food-events

Angular/Node project that searches for events that contain food terms using the Meetup API:
https://www.meetup.com/meetup_api/docs/2/open_events/

Then displays event information with these terms colored in red.

Potential development trajectory is:
1. Add a search box to dynamically filter results on front end
2. Add geolocation
3. Make it look better on mobile
4. => Angular 5
5. Provide a way to hide events already looked at
